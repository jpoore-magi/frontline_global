  <h2>What Travelers Say</h2>
  <div class="testimonial">
    <p>“I recently returned from an international trip that didn’t quite go as planned, and I can honestly say that choosing Frontline Global as my travel insurance provider made all the difference. From the moment I purchased the policy, I felt a genuine sense of security knowing that I had coverage tailored specifically to the realities of modern travel. When a medical emergency arose during my stay abroad, Frontline Global's response was fast, compassionate, and incredibly efficient. They helped coordinate care, covered the expenses promptly, and even provided follow-up support once I returned home. Without their guidance, what could have been a chaotic and stressful experience was handled with professionalism and ease.

What really stood out to me was how seamless their claims process was. Submitting documents and communicating with their support team was straightforward, and I never felt like I had to fight for the coverage I was promised. It’s rare to find an insurance company that not only delivers on its commitments but does so with empathy and respect for the traveler’s situation. I can wholeheartedly recommend Frontline Global to anyone planning a trip—whether it's for business, vacation, or even an extended stay. Their coverage gave me peace of mind, and now, I won't travel without them..”</p>
